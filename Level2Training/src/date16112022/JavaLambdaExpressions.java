//new and important feature of java included in the javaSE8.provides a clear and consice way to represent 
//one method interface using a single expression
//very much useful in collection library which helps to iterate,filter and extract data from collections.
//The Lambda expression is used to provide the implementation of an interface which has functional 
//interface. It saves a lot of code. In case of lambda expression, we don't need to define the 
//method again for providing the implementation. Here, we just write the implementation code.
//Java lambda expression is treated as a function, so compiler does not create .class file.
//@FunctionalInterface:Lambda expression provides implementation of functional interface. An interface which has 
//only one abstract method is called functional interface. Java provides an anotation @FunctionalInterface, which 
//is used to declare an interface as functional interface.

//Advantages of Lambda expressions:
//To provide the implementation of Functional interface.
//Less coding.
